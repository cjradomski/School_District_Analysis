# School District Analysis Using Pandas
In this analysis, data from a school district is explored to determine the performance of certain schools in relation to reading and math scores, population, funding, and school type. Data was imported as CSV files.

## Technologies Used
* Language: Python
* Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
* Packages: pandas

## Results
After importing the data, performing exploratory data analysis, and cleaning the data, the following conclusions were made based on the analysis.

The district had an overall passing rate of 65% with a budget of $24,649,428. There was a 74% pass rate in math and 85% pass rate in reading. 

The top performing schools includes:
  * Cabrera High School
  * Thomas High School
  * Griffin High School
  * Wilson High School 
  * Pena High School
  
  Schools with less than $584 of funding per student performed at an overall passing rate of 90%.
  
  Small and medium sized schools performed at an overall passing rate of 90-91% while large schools (2,000 - 5,000) performed at 58%.
  
  Charter Schools performed at an overall passing rate of 90% and district schools performed at 54%.
  
## Challenge
Data from the ninth grade class Thomas High School were changed and had to be removed from the analysis. Significant changes in previous findings include:

* Thomas High School is no longer considered a top performing school.
* Areas where overall performance decreased:

      * Charter Schools
      * Medium sized schools (1,000 - 2,000)
      * Schools with funding in the range of $630 - $644 (per student)
