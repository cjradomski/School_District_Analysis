# School_District_Analysis
In this analysis, data from a school district explored to determine the performance of certain schools in relation to reading and math scores, population, funding, and school type.

## Results
The district had an overall passing rate of 65% with a budget of $24,649,428. There was a 74% pass rate in math and 85% pass rate in reading. 

The top performing schools includes:
  * Cabrera High School
  * Thomas High School
  * Griffin High School
  * Wilson High School 
  * Pena High School
  
  Schools with less than $584 of funding per student performed at an overall passing rate of 90%.
  
  Small and medium sized schools performed at an overall passing rate of 90-91% while large schools (2,000 - 5,000) performed at 58%.
  
  Charter Schools performed at an overall passing rate of 90% and district schools performed at 54%.
  
## Challenge
Data from the ninth grade class Thomas High School were changed and had to be removed from the analysis. Significant changes in previous findings include:

* Thomas High School is no longer considered a top performing school.
* Areas where overall performance decreased
      * Charter Schools
      * Medium sized schools (1,000 - 2,000)
      * Schools with funding in the range of $630 - $644 (per student)
